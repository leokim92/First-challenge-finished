## Overview

### The challenge

I didn't use JSON for this challenge because I didn't studied it yet.
I focused on what I learned in my Web development courses wich are the list below in "My Process"

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Box Modeling

### What I learned

I learned more about flexbox and how it works, but as you can see I didn't use Grid at all and maybe for that reason, I used more code lines than I should..  

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
    background-color: hsl(0, 100%, 67%, 0.1);
}

I didnt know that you can add opacity inside the background color without affecting the text inside the container, so that's was good.

### Continued development

I should focuse more about Grid, and mixing it with Flexbox.. I saw some videos of Kevin Powell about using Font variables and a lot of coding that I don't know how to apply yet.
To get the result I just did the classic way of copping the font from Google font with @import and add font family on my CSS.

## Acknowledgments

I couldn't make the opacity for my SUMMARY SCORES without making the name and the score trasnparent too, so I used CHAT GPT to guide with that part. So.. I guess using the IA can solve some of your problems, keeping in mind that It has to be used as a tool and not your problem solver.
